gnome-backgrounds-classic
=========================

This module contains a selection of backgrounds that were packaged with the
GNOME desktop, but were removed for 'refreshing'. This is designed to coexist
with the regular gnome-backgrounds package.

Like the regular gnome backgrounds package, the selection of wallpapers here
will change over time.
